- **More varied geometric structures:** From dense clusters to sparse distributions
- **Enhanced color diversity:** Better utilization of the full color spectrum
- **Improved fractal complexity:** More intricate self-similar patterns

## Detailed Groq Vision Analysis Comparison

### Previous Best Image: mass_0935_flip_smallest_simple_9071pts.png

**Groq Vision Analysis (8/10):**
```
This quaternion attractor image displays a fascinating fractal-like structure with intricate mathematical patterns. The image shows a central dense cluster of points surrounded by radiating branches, creating a complex geometric formation. The color distribution ranges from deep blues and purples in the center to lighter blues and whites at the edges, indicating varying point densities and mathematical transformations.

The geometric structures reveal self-similarity at different scales, characteristic of fractal mathematics. The central cluster appears to be the primary attractor point, while the surrounding branches suggest complex quaternion dynamics and transformations. The overall pattern resembles a mathematical flower or star formation, with each branch containing smaller fractal details.

What makes this image particularly interesting is the balance between density and complexity - it's not too dense to obscure the underlying patterns, yet complex enough to reveal the intricate mathematical relationships inherent in quaternion attractors.

### Current Best Image: uniform_0057_flip_smallest_simple_7353pts.png

**Groq Vision Analysis (8/10):**
```
This quaternion attractor image exhibits an exceptional fractal structure with remarkable mathematical complexity. The image displays a central dense core surrounded by intricate branching patterns that extend outward in multiple directions, creating a complex geometric formation reminiscent of a mathematical tree or neural network.

The color distribution is particularly striking, with deep purples and blues in the central region transitioning to lighter blues and whites at the periphery. This color gradient effectively represents the varying point densities and mathematical transformations occurring throughout the attractor space.

The geometric structures reveal multiple levels of self-similarity, with each branch containing smaller fractal details that mirror the overall pattern. The central cluster appears to be the primary attractor point, while the surrounding branches suggest complex quaternion dynamics and transformations.

What makes this image particularly interesting is the enhanced fractal complexity and the more sophisticated color distribution, which better represents the underlying mathematical relationships in the quaternion attractor system.
