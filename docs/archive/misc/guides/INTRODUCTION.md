## 🚀 **Draft01 Implementation**

This document describes the mathematical concepts and visual possibilities of the Quaternion Attractor system in its new **draft01 implementation**. The system now features:

- **⚡ Dual Compilation**: AssemblyScript source compiles to both WebAssembly (high-performance) and JavaScript (universal compatibility)
- **🎯 Unified API**: Clean interface for constant parameters and render parameters
- **🔄 Deterministic**: Seed-based reproducibility across all platforms
- **🌐 Cross-Platform**: Same mathematical results in browser and Node.js environments

## 🎛️ **New API Design**

The draft01 implementation introduces a clean, unified API that separates concerns:

### **Constant Parameters** (Mathematical Core)
- **START**: Initial quaternion point for the attractor
- **ADDITIVE**: 3D vector for phyllotaxis tuning and pattern generation
- **WIND**: Constant rotation quaternion affecting the dynamics
- **MODE**: Side flip variation selector (0, 1, or 2)

### **Render Parameters** (Visualization)
- **Projection Type**: Simple (2D direct) vs Sphere (3D rotation + projection)
- **Camera Rotation**: Quaternion for rendering-time rotation
- **Batch Size**: Number of 2D points to generate per call

### **Output Interface**
```typescript
interface AttractorResult {
  points: Point2D[];           // Generated 2D points for rendering
  finalQuaternion: Quaternion; // Final state for chaining operations
}
```

## 🔬 The Mathematical Foundation

### The 4D Sphere and Stereographic Projection

At its core, this system works with **quaternions**—mathematical objects that live on a 4-dimensional sphere (S³). But we can't see 4D directly, so we use a clever trick called **stereographic projection** to map the 4D sphere onto our familiar 3D space.

Think of it like this:
- Imagine a 3D sphere (like Earth) and you want to project it onto a 2D map
- Stereographic projection does something similar, but from 4D to 3D
- The result is a perfect, distortion-free mapping that preserves all the geometric relationships

### Hemisphere Magic

The 4D sphere has two hemispheres (like Earth's northern and southern hemispheres), and our system can work with both:
- **North Hemisphere**: Traditional mathematical approach
- **South Hemisphere**: Opens up entirely new pattern possibilities
- **Seamless Switching**: The system automatically handles transitions between hemispheres

## 🎯 The Three Attractor Variations

The magic happens when points try to "escape" the mathematical boundaries. Instead of just stopping, we apply different **flipping strategies** that create completely different visual behaviors:

### **Variation 0: The Pure Mathematician**
```
Plain Flip - No coordinate changes, just hemisphere switching
```
- **Visual Character**: Clean, uniform, mathematically precise
- **Best For**: Understanding the pure algorithm, maximum coverage
- **Pattern Style**: Balanced, symmetrical, covering the entire space evenly

### **Variation 1: The Delicate Artist**
```
Flip Smallest Component - Only the tiniest coordinate changes
```
- **Visual Character**: Subtle, filigree-like, with gentle geometric biases
- **Best For**: Creating delicate, organic-looking patterns
- **Pattern Style**: Weak attractors near coordinate planes, like mathematical lace

### **Variation 2: The Dramatic Performer**
```
Flip All Except Largest - Preserve the dominant direction
```
- **Visual Character**: Bold, elongated, with strong directional emphasis
- **Best For**: VJ-style effects, dramatic visual performances
- **Pattern Style**: Stretched geometries, flows along dominant axes
