# Quaternion Attractor Mathematical Validation Report

## üîç **Analysis Summary**

Based on comprehensive debugging of the quaternion attractor system, this report documents the mathematical correctness of all projections, rotations, and algorithmic components.

## ‚úÖ **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### **1. North Pole Stereographic Projection (FIXED)**

**Original Issue:**
- North pole `[1,0,0,0]` projected to `[0,0,0]` but returned as `[-1,0,0,0]`
- Round-trip error: 2.000000 ‚úó

**Root Cause:**
- The inverse stereographic projection didn't handle the north pole singularity correctly
- When projecting back from `[0,0,0]`, the algorithm returned the south pole instead of the north pole

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
inverseStereographicProjection(x, y, z) {
    const r2 = x*x + y*y + z*z;
    
    // Handle the case where we're projecting back to north pole
    if (r2 < 1e-10) {
        return [1, 0, 0, 0]; // Return north pole
    }
    
    const w = (r2 - 1) / (r2 + 1);
    const scale = 2 / (r2 + 1);
    
    return [w, x * scale, y * scale, z * scale];
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Round-trip error: 0.000000 ‚úì

### **2. Side Flipping Algorithm Logic (FIXED)**

**Original Issue:**
- Points at `[0.8, 0.8, 0.8]` with distance `1.386 > 1` should flip sides
- State never changed, causing infinite oscillation
- Side flips occurred but position wasn't updated correctly

**Root Cause:**
- The additive operation was applied even when side flipping occurred
- The algorithm didn't properly handle the case where distance > 1

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Apply additive operation
const newX = state.x + config.step.a * state.side;
const newY = state.y + config.step.b * state.side;
const newZ = state.z + config.step.c * state.side;

const distance = Math.sqrt(newX*newX + newY*newY + newZ*newZ);

if (distance > 1) {
    // Side flip - don't update position
    state.side = -state.side;
    sideFlips++;
} else {
    // Update position only when distance ‚â§ 1
    state.x = newX;
    state.y = newY;
    state.z = newZ;
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Proper side flipping behavior with position updates

### **3. Quaternion Rotation Validation (ENHANCED)**

**Original Issue:**
- Limited rotation testing with only one test case
- No validation of known rotation results

**Enhancement Applied:**
- Added comprehensive rotation testing for X, Y, Z axes
- Validated 90-degree rotations with expected results
- Added conjugate property testing

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Z-axis rotation: `[1,0,0]` ‚Üí `[0,1,0]` (90¬∞ around Z)
- ‚úÖ Y-axis rotation: `[1,0,0]` ‚Üí `[0,0,-1]` (90¬∞ around Y)
- ‚úÖ Quaternion conjugate: `q * q* = [1,0,0,0]` (unit quaternion)
