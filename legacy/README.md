# Legacy Files

This folder contains historical development files and experimental implementations that are no longer part of the active codebase.

## üìÅ Files in this folder:

### **Development/Debug Files**
- `debug_attractor.js` - Original Node.js debugging script (309 lines)
- `enhanced_debug.js` - Enhanced debugging version with additional fixes (307 lines)
- `debug_grid.js` - Obsolete grid testing script (207 lines)

### **Experimental Implementations**
- `improved_mirror_math.js` - Alternative mathematical implementation approach (311 lines)

### **Outdated Documentation**
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Development roadmap that is now complete (332 lines)

## üéØ **Why these files are here:**

1. **`debug_grid.js`** - Superseded by more comprehensive debugging tools
2. **`improved_mirror_math.js`** - Experimental alternative that wasn't used in final implementation
3. **`debug_attractor.js`** - Original debugging script, superseded by enhanced_debug.js
4. **`enhanced_debug.js`** - More advanced debugging but not part of main system
5. **`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** - Planning document that is now complete

## üìù **Current Active Files:**

The main implementation now consists of:
- `quaternion_attractor.js` - Main implementation
- `index.html` - Web interface
- `README.md` - User documentation
- `INTRODUCTION.md` - Conceptual guide
- `MATHEMATICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete mathematical reference
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Project overview
- `validation_report.md` - Testing results
- `package.json` - Node.js configuration

## üîÑ **If you need these files:**

These files are preserved for historical reference and development purposes. If you need to reference the debugging tools or experimental implementations, they are available here.

**Note**: The main system is complete and production-ready. These legacy files are not needed for normal operation.
