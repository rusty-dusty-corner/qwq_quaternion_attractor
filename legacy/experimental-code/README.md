# 🧪 Experimental Code (Legacy)

**Purpose:** This directory is reserved for experimental implementations, prototypes, and research code.

---

## 📁 **Current Status**

This directory is currently **empty** and serves as a placeholder for future experimental code that may need to be preserved for reference.

---

## 🎯 **Intended Use**

This folder should be used for:

- **Prototypes** - Early implementations that didn't make it to production
- **Research Code** - Experimental approaches and algorithms
- **Proof of Concepts** - Demonstrations of new ideas
- **Alternative Implementations** - Different approaches to the same problem
- **Learning Experiments** - Code written while learning new technologies

---

## 📋 **Guidelines**

### **When to Move Code Here**
- Code that was replaced by a better implementation
- Experimental features that didn't work out
- Research code that's no longer active
- Alternative approaches that were explored

### **Documentation Requirements**
- Each experimental folder should have a README.md
- Explain what the experiment was trying to achieve
- Document why it was abandoned or replaced
- Include any lessons learned

### **File Organization**
```
experimental-code/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── feature-name-2025-01/        # Date-based folders for experiments
│   ├── README.md               # Experiment documentation
│   └── source-code/            # Actual experimental code
└── prototype-name/              # Named prototypes

    └── implementation/
```

## 🚀 **Current Active Development**

For active development, use:
- **Main Code**: `src/` directory
- **Tools**: `tools/` directory  
- **Examples**: `src/examples/`
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory

---

**🎯 This directory is ready for future experimental code that needs to be preserved for reference or learning purposes.**
